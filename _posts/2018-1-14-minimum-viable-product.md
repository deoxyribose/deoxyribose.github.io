A canonical virtue of science and engineering is simplicity. Between two theories that explain a phenomenon equally well, a scientist chooses the simpler one. Why? 
Occam's razor says not to "multiply causes", and its 20th century [Bayesian formalization](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/papers/05occam/occam.pdf) says that hypotheses that are "hard to vary" should be preferred. I borrow the "hard to vary" phrase from David Deutsch, who builds his epistemology on this principle. 

For years, the other great benefit of simplicity, which is that simple things are easier to build and maintain,
