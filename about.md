Hi! Welcome to the [Late & Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable) blog. 

I blog about my attempts at [automating](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/535041/automating-the-data-scientists/) [machine](http://www.ml4aad.org/automl/) [learning](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/current-state-automated-machine-learning.html), which is what I'm researching as a PhD student at [CogSys](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/Cogsys). In contrast to most work in this field, which tries to automate classification and regression, I'm interested in automating unsupervised learning.
